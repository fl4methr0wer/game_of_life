# Conway's Game of Life

This project implements Conway's Game of Life in Java using a Maven project structure. 
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
